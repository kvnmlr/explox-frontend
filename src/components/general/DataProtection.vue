    <h1>Data Protection Information</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>General information</h2>
    <p>The following study "ExploX" is part of a research project at the German Research Center for Artificial
      Intelligence (DFKI).</p>

    <h2>Voluntary participation and freely given consent</h2>
    <p>Participation in the study is voluntary. The consent to participate in this study can be revoked at any time and
      without giving reasons until the end of the data collection process by either ending closing the user profile (a
      corresponding
      button is available on the website) or writing and e-mail to exploxcycling@gmail.com. All incomplete data records
      will be deleted by
      us. After the end of data collection, the statutory rights of revocation, information, correction, blocking and
      deletion can no longer be exercised because the data can no longer be attributed to the data subject.</p>

    <h2>What data do we collect from you?</h2>
    <p>After consent to the collection of data, the following data are collected and processed anonymously:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entries in the online survey</li>
      <li>Strava athlete, routes and activities</li>
      <li>Entries in the route rating forms</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web
      space
      provider (so called server log files), is collected:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Date and time of your visit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This anonymous data is not merged with the survey data. On this website we use so-called cookies. Cookies are
      small
      files that are stored by your web browser. The cookies used on our website do not cause any damage to your
      computer
      and do not contain any malicious software. They enable a user-friendly and effective use of this website. We use
      permanent cookies with a maximum validity period of 365 days. We use these cookies to store sessions when the
      browser
      window is closed.</p>

    <h2>Anonymization of data</h2>
    <p>With the transfer of the collected data to our server, an anonymization takes place, which makes it practically
      impossible to assign the collected data to a person, as long as no personal data is entered in free text
      fields.</p>

    <h2>What do we use your data for?</h2>
    <p>The results and data are used exclusively for scientific research purposes and will be published anonymously as
      part
      of a scientific publication of this study. They can also be processed anonymously for other scientific research
      purposes.</p>

    <h2>Contact person</h2>
    <p>The DFKI is responsible for carrying out this study. Contact persons at DFKI is Frederik Wiehr
      (frederik.wiehr@dfki.de).
      If you have any questions that are not answered in this privacy statement, or if you would like further
      information
      on data protection, please contact our data protection officer (datenschutz@dfki.de).</p>

    <h2>Right of Appeal</h2>
    <p>You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority if you are of the opinion that the processing of your
      personal data violates statutory data protection regulations.</p>
